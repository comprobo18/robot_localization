    Function: init_particles
    Inputs: MapModel

    Generates a random distribution of particles across the known map.
    Particle positions must be valid points on the map.
    All particles have equal weight.

    Regenerates particle distribution based on the relative weights of particles.
    The same number of particles are chosen, but more particles will be chosen
    near more likely positions.
